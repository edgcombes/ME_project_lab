This is my newly added line of text for our class changes.
Hello there, my name is Michelle and some people call me "Edgy" as a nickname.
I'm really trying my best to better understand GIT and what it encompasses for me or my team.
I have taken a mini-course at one time in which we set a lot of things up and I'm not really positive why I can use it.

Nice to meet you over Git! I'm KaylaRose.
Best of luck with your coding journey.
I got pulled into the tech world thru Salesforce (SF).
It's really cool. Feel free to ping me about anything related to SF or coding in general ;)
